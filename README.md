# 90's Portfolio

This is the OS or the 2D part of my god knows what itteration of my first [3D Portfolio](github.com/solomonshalom/personal-portfolio). I wanted to make a portfolio that was pretty out-standing, something unique to showcase for in my university application. So, after few days of brainstorming - I decieded to make a retro-style OS kinda portfolio, if that makes sense (I am trying my best here to explain :,)). It's pretty fresh, has some bugs so I need to solve them but in temrs of it's completion

# Development // Self Host

Step 1 - 
```
git clone https://github.com/solomonshalom/90s-portfolio && cd 90's-portfolio
```

Step 2 -
```
yarn && yarn dev
```

Step 3 (Have [vercel](https://vercel.com))- 
```
vercel deploy --prebuilt
```

This should have the website set and ready to go, both locally and in cloud.
